## 1. Overview

This document provides internal code documentation for the `demo.component.ts` Angular component. This component utilizes the `LandingFixService` to manage a specific "fix" during its lifecycle.  The component's primary function is to apply and subsequently remove this fix.

## 2. Component Details

This component is a simple Angular component that interacts with a service to manage a landing page fix. It demonstrates a basic lifecycle hook implementation using `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy`.


### 2.1 `constructor()`

```typescript
constructor(
  private fix: LandingFixService
) { }
```

The constructor injects an instance of `LandingFixService` into the component.  This service is used to apply and remove a landing page fix. The `private` keyword ensures that the service is only accessible within the component.


### 2.2 `ngOnInit()`

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  this.fix.addFix();
}
```

The `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is called immediately after Angular creates the component.  In this component, it calls the `addFix()` method of the injected `LandingFixService`. This method presumably applies a previously defined fix to the landing page.  No error handling or result checking is implemented in this simple example.


### 2.3 `ngOnDestroy()`

```typescript
ngOnDestroy() {
  this.fix.removeFix();
}
```

The `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook is called just before Angular destroys the component.  This component uses it to call the `removeFix()` method of the `LandingFixService`. This method is responsible for reversing or cleaning up the fix applied in `ngOnInit`.  Again, no error handling or result checking is explicitly shown.


## 3. External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

| Dependency          | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@angular/core`     | Provides core Angular functionalities, including lifecycle hooks.          |
| `LandingFixService` | A custom service responsible for applying and removing a landing page fix. |


This component's simplicity makes detailed algorithmic explanations unnecessary. The core logic involves straightforward calls to methods within the `LandingFixService`.  More complex error handling or logic would warrant a more extensive description.
