## 1. Overview

This document provides internal documentation for the `app-footer` Angular component. This component renders the footer section of the application.  It currently has minimal functionality, acting primarily as a placeholder for future features.


## 2. Component Structure

The `app-footer` component is a simple Angular component defined using the `@Component` decorator.

| Attribute       | Value/Description                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `selector`      | `app-footer` - This is the selector used in HTML templates to include the component. |
| `templateUrl`   | `./footer.component.html` -  Path to the component's HTML template.     |
| `styleUrls`     | `./footer.component.scss` - Path to the component's SCSS stylesheet. |


The component class `FooterComponent` implements the `OnInit` interface. This indicates that the component will utilize the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook.


## 3. `ngOnInit()` Method

```typescript
  ngOnInit() {
  }
```

The `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook is currently empty.  This method is called after Angular has fully initialized the component's view.  It's a placeholder for any initialization logic that might be required in the future, such as fetching data or setting up subscriptions.  No specific algorithms or complex logic are implemented within this method at present.


## 4. Constructor

```typescript
  constructor() { }
```

The constructor is empty.  It doesn't inject any dependencies at this time.  This is a simple, default constructor and indicates that the component doesn't require any services or other dependencies for its current functionality.  No complex initialization or dependency injection is performed.
