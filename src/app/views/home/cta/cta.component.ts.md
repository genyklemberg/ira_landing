## 1. Overview

This document details the Angular component `cta.component.ts`. This component likely represents a "Call To Action" (CTA) element within a larger application.  Its primary function is to provide a mechanism for users to navigate to an external URL.  Currently, the only implemented CTA is a link to purchase the "Egret" Angular template.


## 2. Component Structure

The `cta.component.ts` file defines a single Angular component, `CtaComponent`, using the `@Component` decorator.

| Property        | Description                                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `selector`      | Specifies the component's selector used in HTML templates (`<app-cta>`).     |
| `templateUrl`   | Specifies the path to the component's HTML template (`./cta.component.html`).|
| `styleUrls`     | Specifies the path to the component's CSS stylesheet (`./cta.component.scss`).|


The component implements the `OnInit` interface, although the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is currently empty.  It also contains a single function, `buyEgret()`,  detailed below.


## 3. `buyEgret()` Function Detail

The `buyEgret()` function is designed to redirect the user to a specific URL.

```typescript
  buyEgret() {
    // window.open('https://themeforest.net/item/egret-angular-4-material-design-admin-template/20161805?ref=mh_rafi');
  }
```

**Functionality:**

The function's original intent (indicated by the commented-out code) was to open the specified URL in a new browser tab or window using the `window.open()` method.  This method takes the URL as an argument and opens it in a new window.  The URL points to a ThemeForest listing for an Angular admin template.

**Algorithm:**

The algorithm is straightforward:

1. The `buyEgret()` function is called (presumably via a button click or similar interaction in the associated HTML template).
2. The `window.open()` method is (currently commented out) executed.
3. The specified URL is opened in a new browser window or tab.

**Current State:**

The `window.open()` call is currently commented out.  This suggests that the functionality may be temporarily disabled or is awaiting further implementation.  The reason for commenting out this code is not specified within the code itself.
