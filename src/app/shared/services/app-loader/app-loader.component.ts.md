## 1. Overview

The `AppLoaderComponent` is an Angular component designed to display a loading indicator or modal dialog to the user.  It provides a simple interface for displaying a title and a message while an asynchronous operation is in progress.  The component leverages Angular Material's `MatDialogRef` to manage its lifecycle and interaction with the parent component.


## 2. Component Structure

The component is defined using Angular's `@Component` decorator.  Key aspects are:

| Property          | Description                                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `selector`       | `app-app-loader` - This selector is used to include the component in other templates. |
| `templateUrl`    | `./app-loader.component.html` - Path to the component's HTML template.           |
| `styleUrls`      | `./app-loader.component.css` - Path to the component's CSS stylesheet.            |


The component declares two properties:

* `title`:  A string to display as the title of the loading indicator.  (Currently not initialized or used)
* `message`: A string to display as the message of the loading indicator. (Currently not initialized or used)


## 3. Constructor

The constructor injects an instance of `MatDialogRef<AppLoaderComponent>`.

```typescript
constructor(public dialogRef: MatDialogRef<AppLoaderComponent>) {}
```

* **`dialogRef`**: This provides access to methods for closing the dialog (`dialogRef.close()`) and interacting with the parent component that opened the dialog.  The generic type `<AppLoaderComponent>` specifies that this `MatDialogRef` is associated with this component.  This allows for data to be passed back to the parent component when the dialog is closed.


## 4. `ngOnInit()` Method

The `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook is currently empty:

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
}
```

This method is called after Angular initializes the component's inputs and services.  Currently, no initialization logic is implemented within this method, however, this is a suitable place to add any initialization logic for the loading indicator (such as fetching data, setting default values, or subscribing to observables).
